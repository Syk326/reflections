When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This would be useful when working with a team that's adding code to a shared project, and when working on a project over multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There may be material that you're working on that you don't want to overwrite, and you could want to push instead.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones of another user's repo on GitHub. Clones are copies, which forks are a type of, except that they involve copying a repo or a local dir. As for branches, they are different from the main master commit and take the project in a different direction.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit of having that local copy is that not only is it fast, but it doesn't rely on an internet connection.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would use Google Docs, so that collab would be real-time in docs. For code, I would probably just have to email files back and forth, or save on a common server, which would be very inconvenient.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
You would make a change in a separate branch if you were working on an experimental features, or wanted to collaborate with a colleague before merging it into master. Working on master is simpler, but branches gives you that extra option.
